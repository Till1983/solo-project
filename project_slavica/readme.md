Slavic language and dialect research platform


Slavic languages, like any other language group, include a wide variety of local dialects that differ from the national standard languages in several ways. 
The purpose of this platform is to document not just their geographical distribution but their differences from the standard language in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. 
The user will be able to click on the country of their choice and find the different dialectal zones of that country clearly designated. 
Upon clicking on a dialectal zone, the user will be able to listen to audio samples, or watch a short video of a native speaker of the respective dialect. 
A written transcription of what is said will be displayed as subtitles in or below the video/audio-clip. 
A second set of subtitles will display the same text in the standard language for the purpose of direct comparison.
In addition to the audio/video samples of dialectal speech, the user will find samples of poems, short stories, theatre play written and/or performed in the respective dialect. 
More options may be added in the future.
